mongod is server
mongo is it.

for change db
mongod --dbpath "/data/db-where-it-is"

show dbs

use <name>

db.<name of collection>

mongdb server --> storage engine (wild tiger) ---> data

storage engine : it load some of data to memory and some data to hdd
it is a lot faster

ObjectId is special type by mongdb

BSON : binary json. efficient storage.

CRUD operations have 3 args filter, data, options.

updateOne({criteria}, {$set : {market : "sth"}})

insertMay([take arr])

update() with replace document.

find() bring back cursor object (not 20000000 milion doc)
toArray() will remove cursor object.

Projection : filter response data on mongo.
projections seat on second argument.
passengers.find({}, { name : 1, _id: 0})

it prevent from bandwith consumption.

Embeded document : value of field can be doc, nested document
we can have up to 100 level nesting
the overall doc size must be below 16mb.

Array : can have arrays of embeded document,

Dbs and Collections are created lazily.

filter restrice amount of docs , projections restrice fields per doc
